# MarwynnBot <img align="right" src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/762/243/edd.jpg" height="100" width="100">
I am a general purpose discord bot written in python using discord.py, a Discord API Wrapper. I am currently under
development, so please expect new features to come and any issues to be addressed as soon as I can.

## Add Me To Your Server ![uptime](https://img.shields.io/badge/uptime-90.0%25-brightgreen)
You can add the public MarwynnBot to your own Discord server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=623317451811061763&scope=bot&permissions=8)

## Prefix
- The default prefix is `m!`
- Global prefixes are mentioning the bot or `mb` *(case insensitive)*

## Commands ![progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-20%25-orange)
WIP, for an updated list, add the bot and do `m!help`.

Commands are separated into categories that determine a command's function. I am currently working on making a website
that will display all of MarwynnBot's commands. Please stay tuned for its release

For a guide on all commands and their usages, I will be updating [MarwynnBot's Website](http://www.marwynnbot.tk)
## Self Hosting
I would prefer that you not create an instance of this bot/repo for self hosting purposes. This repository is
public only for educational purposes. If you choose to self host, you are on your own. I will not be providing any
help or support for those who choose to self host. If you would like to use MarwynnBot, please use the invite
link provided above
