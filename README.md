# MarwynnBot <img align="right" src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/762/243/edd.jpg" height="100" width="100">
I am a general purpose discord bot written in python using discord.py, a Discord API Wrapper. I am currently under
development, so please expect new features to come and any issues to be addressed as soon as I can.

## Add Me To Your Server ![uptime](https://img.shields.io/badge/uptime-90.0%25-brightgreen)
You can add the public MarwynnBot to your own Discord server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=623317451811061763&scope=bot&permissions=8)

## Prefix
- The default prefix is `m!`
- Global prefixes are mentioning the bot or `mb`

## Commands ![progress](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-20%25-orange)

## Self Hosting
As of right now, this bot is nowhere near ready for self hosting. I commit many changes to the bot and there is a high
chance that after you clone this repository, I will have added a feature or fixed an issue that was present in the
previous commit.

Upon gaining Discord Verification, this bot's source code will become closed source and I will stop pushing commits to
this repository. There are are some features that this bot will support that are very resource demanding, and they will
become premium only commands. Please note that there will be very few commands that fit under this category, so the vast
majority of the bot's functions will be accessible to anyone.

I would prefer that you do not create an instance of my bot for self hosting purposes. I have made this repository
public so that anyone who needs an example of a bot written in discord.py can freely look at how I have made it. I do
realise that my python is garbage, and I am working on improving as this project is developed.
